# Deno Fresh PWA

Some people have reached out and asked me to do a talk on Deno Fresh and Progressive Web Apps (PWA) and I thought this would be a great topic to create a presentation for.

## What is a PWA?

Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are web apps that use service workers, manifests, and other web-platform features in combination with progressive enhancement to give users an experience similarly found with native apps.
